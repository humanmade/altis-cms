# Permalinks

Altis introduces a fix to a bug where the main site on a network is hard-coded to contain `/blog/` prefix for posts by default. The
side-effect for this is that you cannot use `/blog/` prefix on the main site unless you disable the fix, which is by unhooking the
filters associated with it, e.g.:

```php
add_action( 'plugins_loaded', function () {
    remove_filter( 'sanitize_option_permalink_structure', 'Altis\CMS\Permalinks\remove_blog_prefix' );
    remove_filter( 'option_permalink_structure', 'Altis\CMS\Permalinks\remove_blog_prefix' );
} );
```

Note that the prefix will always be used by the main site now, regardless of what permalink structure you choose in settings, in
other terms, you don't need to add the `/blog/` prefix to the custom permalink structure, or you'll have it duplicated in the URL.
